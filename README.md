# Calories Data Classification  

This project focuses on building a pipeline to classify and predict calorie consumption from user activity data. By leveraging data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and training machine learning models, the project achieves high predictive accuracy through model optimization.  

## Key Features  
- **Classification Pipeline**: Developed a complete pipeline for calorie prediction using user activity data.  
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted extensive **data preprocessing** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to extract insights.  
- **Machine Learning Models**: Trained and compared **Random Forest** and **Decision Tree** models for classification.  
- **Model Optimization**: Enhanced model performance by tuning hyperparameters to achieve high predictive accuracy.  

## Technologies  
- **Python** for data manipulation and model training.  
- **Pandas** for data preprocessing and analysis.  
- **scikit-learn** for machine learning model implementation and evaluation.  

## Results  
- **Accuracy**: Achieved high predictive accuracy through model optimization.  
- **Insights**: Extracted meaningful relationships between activity data and calorie consumption.  

## Dataset  
The dataset consists of user activity data annotated with calorie consumption.
